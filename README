XML::UM version 0.01
====================

DESCRIPTION

This module provides methods to convert UTF-8 strings to any XML encoding that XML::Encoding supports. It creates
mapping routines from the .xml files that can be found in the maps/ directory in the XML::Encoding distribution. Note that
the XML::Encoding distribution does install the .enc files in your perl directory, but not the.xml files they were created
from. That's why you have to specify $ENCDIR as in the SYNOPSIS. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
